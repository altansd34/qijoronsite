When a&nbsp;<a href=# title=spouse data-link=tag>spouse</a> is&nbsp;willing to&nbsp;share only the happiest moments with&nbsp;us and leaves&nbsp;us in&nbsp;times of&nbsp;need and uncertainty, we&nbsp;can’t be&nbsp;in&nbsp;awe of&nbsp;such an&nbsp;attitude. Our today’s protagonist is&nbsp;a&nbsp;man, whose behavior towards his wife wouldn’t make any woman happy. He&nbsp;broke up&nbsp;with her and left her to&nbsp;struggle alone when she was going through the toughest times in&nbsp;her life. But the woman was strong enough to&nbsp;turn her pain into her triumph and now the man is&nbsp;desperate about&nbsp;it, seeking advice amidst the judgment that he’s getting from people at&nbsp;the moment.</p><p><h2>Mike and Ava were meant for each other.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9af/189/2ea896519f86d75a9eed6f9f67.jpg><p>Mike, 37, has recently penned an&nbsp;emotional letter to&nbsp;our editorial, sharing his story and asking our readers about their opinions and thoughts. The man is&nbsp;fully aware of&nbsp;the judgment that his situation may cause among people who have a&nbsp;traditional <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> and human values. But with his letter, he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;show our readers that wedding vows are not just mere words and there’s a&nbsp;deep meaning behind them, which he&nbsp;failed to&nbsp;get initially.</p><p>Mike confessed that his mind and soul are now full of&nbsp;regrets about what’s been done. But at&nbsp;the same time, the man feels like life and circumstances turned out too unfair towards him and he&nbsp;wants some things in&nbsp;his life back.</p><p>The man opened his letter, saying, “My&nbsp;wife Ava has always been a&nbsp;slender and beautiful woman. When we&nbsp;first met, my&nbsp;thought was that I’d never be&nbsp;good enough for such a&nbsp;gorgeous woman. There were so&nbsp;many men around Ava, who were admiring her and who were dreaming about her, but she chose&nbsp;me, and it&nbsp;was my&nbsp;biggest pride. Now I&nbsp;understand that&nbsp;I always treated my&nbsp;wife as&nbsp;a&nbsp;trophy, I&nbsp;even fell in&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> with her mainly because of&nbsp;her super-attractive appearance and&nbsp;I failed badly when it&nbsp;came to&nbsp;realizing even a&nbsp;tiny thing about her personality, her mind, and her soul. I&nbsp;was too busy admiring her face and her body and&nbsp;I never bothered to&nbsp;look deeper, which&nbsp;I now regret so&nbsp;badly.”</p><p>Mike goes&nbsp;on, saying, “When we&nbsp;started dating and then got married, my&nbsp;life was like a&nbsp;paradise. I&nbsp;was deeply in&nbsp;love with my&nbsp;wife and&nbsp;I sincerely believed that this would never change. But unfortunately, it&nbsp;did.”</p><p><h2>The happy marriage suffered a&nbsp;fiasco after the birth of&nbsp;the couple’s son.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9af/4c2/49fdd25722a05d5a8966f794e1.jpg><p>Mark continues with his confession, saying, “Ava and&nbsp;I wanted kids more than anything in&nbsp;our lives. We&nbsp;both understood that after a&nbsp;kid is&nbsp;born, new parents have to&nbsp;sacrifice a&nbsp;lot and we&nbsp;both were ready to&nbsp;ditch our comfort zones for the sake of&nbsp;a&nbsp;tiny human being, who was about to&nbsp;be&nbsp;born.</p><p>But it&nbsp;turned out that there was one thing&nbsp;I was never prepared for. And this was the drastic change that&nbsp;I saw in&nbsp;Ava’s appearance and personality after our baby son was born.</p><p>These 9&nbsp;months of&nbsp;her <a href=# title=pregnancy data-link=tag>pregnancy</a>, were the happiest times for&nbsp;us both, we&nbsp;were so&nbsp;happy and Ava was glowing literally. I&nbsp;couldn’t take my&nbsp;eyes off her, and she was radiating beauty and <a href=# title=happiness data-link=tag>happiness</a> throughout her entire pregnancy.”</p><p>Mike added, “However, things got so&nbsp;bad when our baby boy was born. Ava wasn’t a&nbsp;person whom&nbsp;I loved anymore and&nbsp;I felt like&nbsp;I married another woman, not the one who was beside me&nbsp;at&nbsp;that moment.”</p><p><h2>Mike was disappointed with his wife’s appearance and behavior.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/161/b3e/5031055546950afac50fb1d55b.jpg><p>Mike goes on&nbsp;with his story, saying, “Ava changed dramatically, and&nbsp;I was shocked. She put on&nbsp;a&nbsp;significant amount of&nbsp;weight, her body wasn’t in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;shape that it&nbsp;used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;before her pregnancy and childbirth and she started having huge problems with her skin.</p><p>I&nbsp;noticed that Ava’s behavior also changed dramatically. She was constantly irritated and annoyed by&nbsp;anything and everything, she shouted at&nbsp;me&nbsp;and she started crying more often than before, and those tears were because of&nbsp;such trifles as&nbsp;a&nbsp;coffee mug left unwashed in&nbsp;the sink or&nbsp;neighbors who didn’t say hello to&nbsp;her because they didn’t notice her.</p><p>Things were becoming so&nbsp;tense in&nbsp;the family. Despite all my&nbsp;outrageous attempts to&nbsp;help her out with the baby, Ava was still pissed off at&nbsp;everything I&nbsp;did. And she seemed so&nbsp;unattractive to&nbsp;me, that&nbsp;I moved to&nbsp;another room just to&nbsp;avoid sleeping in&nbsp;the same bed with her.</p><p>I&nbsp;realize only now how wrong&nbsp;I was to&nbsp;be&nbsp;such a&nbsp;nasty person, but at&nbsp;that time&nbsp;I was blind and deaf.”</p><p>Mike said, “One day, Ava just came to&nbsp;me&nbsp;and said that we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;divorce. I&nbsp;sighed with relief because this was what I&nbsp;wanted, too. We&nbsp;divorced most civilly and this strong woman didn’t even shed a&nbsp;tear while we&nbsp;were splitting&nbsp;up.”</p><p><h2>After a&nbsp;divorce things changed drastically, but in&nbsp;the least desirable way.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/28d/96e/09bddd517c89db9f14c2a5dd68.jpg><p>Mike shared, “After the divorce, I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;leave the country for my&nbsp;work purposes. I&nbsp;lived in&nbsp;another country for over 3&nbsp;years, and Ava was not in&nbsp;the picture. She did send me&nbsp;the photos of&nbsp;our baby son, and&nbsp;I did come to&nbsp;visit him once or&nbsp;twice, but&nbsp;I didn’t have a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;see them as&nbsp;often as&nbsp;I&nbsp;wanted. And then, the time has come for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;move back to&nbsp;the country.</p><p>When I&nbsp;arrived, I&nbsp;immediately went to&nbsp;Ava’s house, which used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;my&nbsp;home, too. Ava opened the door and&nbsp;I froze in&nbsp;awe, so&nbsp;beautiful she was again. She was smiling and she looked so&nbsp;good and happy that my&nbsp;heart sank.</p><p>I&nbsp;paid her some compliments, but she didn’t react at&nbsp;all. I&nbsp;took my&nbsp;son for a&nbsp;walk and Ava was happy that we&nbsp;had a&nbsp;nice time together. When I&nbsp;came back again, I&nbsp;saw Ava’s photos with another man hanging everywhere on&nbsp;the walls. I&nbsp;asked her who it&nbsp;was and she said that it&nbsp;was her fiancée. I&nbsp;saw that these photos were taken when Ava wasn’t in&nbsp;her best shape, but the man in&nbsp;the photos was holding her in&nbsp;his arms, kissing her, and looking at&nbsp;her with passion and love.</p><p>Ava didn’t tell me&nbsp;much about their <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>. The only thing&nbsp;I remember her saying was that her fiancée always told her that she was the most beautiful woman in&nbsp;the world and that he&nbsp;loved her plus-size forms and every single stretch mark on&nbsp;her body. He&nbsp;found her beautiful even when she was having problems with her skin and postpartum acne. He&nbsp;told her constantly that she was the most beautiful and adorable woman on&nbsp;earth.”</p><p>Mark shared, “I&nbsp;feel like a&nbsp;fool now. I&nbsp;instantly fell in&nbsp;love with Ava again. And not with Ava who was slim and beautiful again, but with that happy woman who was looking at&nbsp;me&nbsp;from the photos with another man.”</p><p>The man added, “I&nbsp;want my&nbsp;wife back now so&nbsp;badly and&nbsp;I regret every single moment of&nbsp;me&nbsp;being such a&nbsp;nasty and disgusting fool. But Ava is&nbsp;happy with another man and she keeps saying to&nbsp;me&nbsp;that I’m only a&nbsp;‘father of&nbsp;her child’ for her. I’m desperate and&nbsp;I don’t know what to&nbsp;do&nbsp;to&nbsp;win my&nbsp;beloved wife back.”</p><p>And here’s a&nbsp;confession of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman who broke a&nbsp;happy <a href=#>family</a> and stole a&nbsp;husband from a&nbsp;desperate and betrayed wife. The mistress expected a&nbsp;paradise with another woman’s husband, but her life turned into a&nbsp;nightmare and she is&nbsp;broken.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZurcGapZ2nnpqxbrnYZq6inpVixKmxzWaqoZ1drK60ecCtZKGdomK5sMPErKtmpp%2Bseqyt0aaYZqCZqXqusYyspmagkaexbsDHmqtmoV2jsqawjKGcpahdbX56gZFrZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./i-thought-he-was-her-new-boyfriend-celine-dion-makes-rare-red-carpet-appearance-with-her-son-819419.html>&#171;&nbsp;I Thought He Was Her New Boyfriend, Cline Dion Makes Rare Red Carpet Appearance With Her Son</a>
