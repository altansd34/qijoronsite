average.</p><p><a href=#>YouGov's nationally-representative opinion polling</a> found that <b>64% of the British public would support</b> stopping child benefit payments to parents whose children persistently fail to attend school.

If they do not, <b>it sends the wrong message to the child, who will think that it is not important</b>” <i>Les G, North Yorkshire</i></p><h3><strong>Argument 2: Fines will ‘foster’ good behaviour</strong></h3><p>“Parents <b>should have instilled a good work ethic and an eagerness to learn in children</b> from an early age” <i>Anon</i></p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/istock_childworking_format.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“If the parents do not have control over their children, then <b>the child's life will spiral out of control early on.</b> School is very important” <i>Chris, Kent</i></p><p><i></i>“<b>Truancy has a long term detrimental impact on both the individual child and often on society</b>. Although parents can't control what the children are doing all the time, they are in a position to foster positive values in their children, and failing to do this is their own fault” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“Maybe <b>showing the parents some discipline will have the effect of prompting them to impose some</b> upon their kids” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“The child is in control, but if the parent is punished then <b>the child sees that their actions cause something to happen to someone that they love, which should change their behaviour” </b><i>Anon</i></p><p>“If society provides parents with benefits and housing, it should demand, in return, that recipients show gratitude by ensuring that they respect society by being law-abiding and respectful citizens. <b>Attending school and being well-behaved there is a very important part of that. Children also need discipline and good role models” </b><i>Laurent, London</i></p><p>“Schools offer a lot of help for parents to get their children to school, so if they won’t work with the school they should pay the price. <b>We have too many children underachieving in school and being absent a lot does not help</b>” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“It <b>instils family values and gives responsibility to the family as a whole</b>.

I believe <b>the child should be punished and from this they will learn their lesson</b>” <i>Emma W, Andover</i></p><p>“Instead of pointing the blame at the parents, <b>a sense of responsibility needs to given to the children themselves</b>.
