Think about when and where you can use that language in the future. What is your motivation to learn it? Do you want to study in a different country? Do you want to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">use a different language for your career</a>? Do you really like a certain culture and want to make communication easier?&nbsp;</p><p>Spanish and German are both great languages. Let’s review a few reasons to choose either German or Spanish.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Learning-German-vs.-Spanish:-Which-one-should-I-choose?>Learning German vs. Spanish: Which one should I choose?</h2><p><strong>German</strong> is the official language of six countries in Western and Central Europe: Germany, Austria, Belgium, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and Switzerland. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">130 million people speak German</a> around the world, and the majority of them live in Germany. If you live in the United States, it might be difficult to find German speakers with whom to practice your new skills. However, your familial heritage or a German descendant population in your geographic area (like in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Midwest</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">parts of Texas</a>) might tickle your curiosity and motivate you to take up studying the language.</p><p><strong>Spanish</strong> certainly offers a greater number of people to practice with; it’s the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">official</a> language of 21 countries. It’s the world’s second-most-spoken native language and the fourth-most-spoken language globally. There are approximately 496 million native speakers of Spanish. If you live in the US and are looking to practice on a daily basis, Spanish is an easy answer. The US and its close neighbor Mexico have the largest Spanish-speaking populations on earth — way more than Spain itself!</p><p>If you don’t live in the US, you may have a more nuanced decision to make. Keeping in mind your life choices and interests will help you choose the language you may find more useful.</p><p>Are you thinking of moving to Europe to study or work? Germany is well-known for its automotive, engineering and pharmaceutical industries. If you want to live in Europe and these industries are of interest to you, then you might want to consider learning German.&nbsp;</p><p>Spain, Mexico and Central and South America are also home to a variety of industries and multinational companies. If you’re interested in studying or working in a Spanish-speaking country, you have many countries to choose from.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Is-German-or-Spanish-easier-to-learn?>Is German or Spanish easier to learn?</h2><p>Still, a question remains in the Spanish vs. German debate:&nbsp; Which language is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">quicker to learn</a>? Is German easier than Spanish? As a native English speaker, certain similarities and differences in each language might make things easier (or harder) for you.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Syntax&nbsp;</h3><p>Spanish generally uses the same subject-verb-object sentence structure that English uses, though it’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">not identical</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>German syntax, or word order, is more varied. The basic <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German sentence structure</a> can be difficult for English language speakers to learn at first.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Vocabulary</h3><p>Both Spanish and German share some cognates with English. This will help you learn vocabulary. But, be careful! There are always <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">false cognates</a> out there.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Noun-adjective agreement</h3><p>In English, nouns are ungendered. Both Spanish and German have gendered nouns and adjectives, so there is a learning curve either way. Spanish has two genders, with feminine and masculine nouns. German has those two plus a third neutral gender, so that might add to the difficulty level.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Verb conjugation</h3><p>Conjugating verbs in Spanish can sometimes be complicated for English speakers. In Spanish, the verb form changes depending on the person (or people), so you need to learn more conjugations.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German verb conjugation</a> has similarities to the sound of cognates in English. This might be easier for a native English speaker to learn quickly.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Pronunciation&nbsp;</h3><p>English has twelve vowel sounds in total. By comparison, Spanish only has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">five vowel sounds</a> that never change. They are straightforward and easy to learn, but they require a sharp ear for non-native speakers to pronounce correctly.&nbsp;</p><p>German has an impressive 17 vowel sounds, many of which are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">similar to English</a>. Still, there are some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unique German letters</a> that have no English equivalent, like ä, ö and ü. Those take time to pronounce correctly, too.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Cultural-benefits-of-learning-Spanish-or-German>Cultural benefits of learning Spanish or German</h2><p>Taking the plunge and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">learning a new l</a>anguage will expand your horizons. After reading about the number of speakers of German vs. Spanish and familiarizing yourself with the technical aspects of each language, you may be wondering about the cultural benefits.</p><p>Culture is an important factor to consider when choosing to learn either German or Spanish. You aren’t just learning a language — you’re also learning about the history and people that speak that language. In short, you’re learning a new cultural perspective. Think about which culture (or cultures, as the case may be) you’d prefer to integrate into. Which are you more excited about?</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Cultural activities in Spanish</h3><p>Are you into Spanish-language music? Hopefully, because it’s everywhere right now! Did you see the TikTok about the Spanish teacher who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">taught her class</a> the lyrics to Mexican singer Peso Pluma’s song “Ella Baila Sola”? Peso Pluma has over <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">52 million</a> monthly listeners on Spotify thanks to this major hit song. He even appeared on Jimmy Fallon to sing his lyrics — all in Spanish, of course. Music from Latin America and Spain are major global influences and great tools for learning the language.&nbsp;</p><p>Do you like watching <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish-language movies</a> or TV series? Would you like to watch them without subtitles?&nbsp;</p><p>Are you a foodie? Mexican cuisine is on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heri</a>tage of Humanity list. The Mediterranean diet found in Spain is also on the list. Do you want to learn the dance language of salsa and bachata? These are all cultural activities that you can get more involved in by learning Spanish.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Cultural activities in German</h3><p>Germany can hold its own in the music scene. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">club culture of Berlin is famous</a>. Ever heard about how hard it is to get into the city’s most notorious underground music club, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Berghain</a>?&nbsp;</p><p>Or do you prefer the symphony? Germany is said to be the birthplace of classical music. There are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">129 professional orchestras</a> that are publicly financed in Germany alone.&nbsp;</p><p>Germany is also well-known for its long tradition of beer brewing and consumption. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oktoberfest </a>in Munich is a popular beer festival open to both locals and tourists.&nbsp;</p><p>Or maybe you love German craftsmanship: cars, clocks, violins and much more. Speaking of cars, there have been 54 German Formula One drivers, including three world champions. The most famous is now-retired Michael Schumacher, a German who holds the most world championship titles in the sport.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Choose what works for you</h2><p>When deciding to learn German or Spanish, it’s best to consider your own interests. Do you have solid plans to travel, or would you prefer to practice speaking to people where you live?&nbsp;<br>The decision to dedicate time to either German or Spanish should be based on which one you are more likely to use — and which one you will enjoy more! Remember, learning a language should be fun. Both languages offer you a window to the world, whether it is through your ears, your eyes or your stomach. Choose what works for you. If you’re still not sure, take a trial <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German class</a> or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish class</a> to get a feel for what you like best.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/alison-2-3.jpg><h2>Alison Maciejewski Cortez</h2><p>Alison Maciejewski Cortez is Chilean-American, born and raised in California.
