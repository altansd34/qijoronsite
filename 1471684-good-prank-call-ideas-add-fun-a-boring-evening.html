Fake food delivery</h3><p class=align-left>Call a friend and inform them that their food has been delivered to their door; if they are perplexed, explain that you are a food delivery driver and that their food has been delivered.</p><p class=align-left>The prank should be done on someone whose address you know so that it appears more credible. It is one of the good prank call ideas that will have your friends running around their house hoping to get a tasty snack!</p><h3>2. Survey calls</h3><p class=align-left>Survey calls are the most common prank calls, with an operator attempting to persuade you to participate in a survey. Call a number and tell the person about an interesting survey in which they can win discount coupons. The majority of people will appear interested in the survey and may not hang up on you.</p><p class=align-left>Then ask them questions like, <i>"Why are the alphabets in that order?" </i>or <i>"Why aren't blueberries blue?" </i>These are some of the best funny things to say when prank calling.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/438a311bb01a5b7d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ old people jokes that elderly and youngsters alike will enjoy</span></p></a><h3>3.

If they ask you questions to figure out who you are, give them some intricate, maybe even wild, specifics about how you two met.</p><h3>4. Problem with toilet paper</h3><p class=align-left>Restaurants are funny places to prank call. Call a restaurant, preferably one on the upscale end of the spectrum, because fast food restaurants are less concerned. When someone answers, use your best upset, panicked voice to explain that you're in their restroom and there's no toilet paper anywhere. Inform them that you have a date at one of their tables and do not want to keep them waiting.</p><h3>5. Free coupons</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/130c2791973a4f96.png><p class=align-left>Call a discount-obsessed friend and tell them you are calling from a business—it could be their <a href=#>favourite restaurant</a> or a brand they love.

Scorned lover</h3><p class=align-left>Call your friend and tell them how much you love and miss them. Using prank call ideas on friends will increase their curiosity. When they ask who's calling, act upset and inquire how many people call to tell them they're loved.</p><p class=align-left>They will most likely be perplexed, but they will continue to act as if they are upset. You get extra points if you can fake crying. The other party will either attempt to comfort you or hang up.</p><h3>7. Sign up for a package</h3><p class=align-left>Call a random number and inform them that a particular package is being delivered to their front door and that they must sign for it.</p><p class=align-left>Recite their address to persuade them if they say you have the wrong number. When the person realizes they've gotten up for nothing, they may become irritated.

If the person you called appears perplexed, persist and pretend that you believe they're joking about not knowing the date.</p><p class=align-left>Tell them you'll meet them at a nearby coffee shop. Then tell them you got stuck in traffic and will call them back before they have an opportunity to argue. It is helpful if you have a mutual friend who can set you up.</p><h3>9. Phone check-up</h3><p class=align-left>You'll need to have an idea about the type of phone your friend uses to try funny call ideas on them. First, call them up and pretend you work for their <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/top/1248932-most-expensive-phone-top-12-prices-descriptions/ href=#>mobile company</a> that wants to check if their phone is in good condition.

Call them and tell them you saw them strolling around the shopping centre or grocery store and that you called out to them, but they didn't see you. Make it believable that you saw them. You get extra points if you acknowledge what they were wearing or even doing.</p><h3>11. Who am I?</h3><p class=align-left>Call your grandma or grandpa and start a conversation in a disguised voice. In the process, ask them whether they know you. Allow them to keep guessing until they give up.</p><h3>12. You own a haunted house</h3><p class=align-left>You can play this prank on someone you know and are confident will not be bothered by the prank call. Call the person and explain that you are the previous owner of their residence and you need to admit something to them.</p><p class=align-left>Then, in a calm tone, inform them that they must pay close attention to you. Tell them that someone died in the house many years ago and that their spirit still haunts the place. Try to sound convincing, but if you notice it's causing the other person distress, stop and let them know it's just a joke.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7e0d17abf099c363.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ being ignored quotes for when you are feeling overlooked</span></p></a><h3>13.

Why are you calling my girlfriend?</h3><p class=align-left>This is yet another unique and amusing prank call. When the person responds, you can continue to irritate them by repeating the phrase <i>"Why are you calling my girlfriend."</i></p><h3>15. Random scary statements</h3><p class=align-left>Call a random friend and scare them by saying things like <i>"I <a href=#>love you</a></i>" or <i>"I've been watching you." </i>You can also scare the person with other spectacular remarks.

It will work best on male friends because it will perplex them.</p><h3>18. Dead body</h3><p class=align-left>This is one of the more frightening prank call ideas. Call someone and tell them you own or live in their home as a tenant.

Fake carpenter prank</h3><p class=align-left>This one works exceptionally well on relatives, but you'll need to create a fictitious brand name.

Remain silent</h3><p class=align-left>This is one of the most straightforward call prank ideas ever and fits well for a beginner.

Happy birthday prank</h3><p class=align-left>You can play this trick with someone you know. Call the person, and immediately they answer, start singing them a happy birthday song without pausing so that you don't give them a chance to speak. Once you are done, they will tell you it isn't their birthday. Pretend to be surprised or insist it is and that they are lying.</p><h3>23. Start a countdown to nothing</h3><p class=align-left>Call your friend, and when they pick up the call, say, <i>"10 hours left".</i> They will ask you what it's for, tell them they will see at the end. Keep calling them to remind them of the hours remaining. It will make them more curious to know.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/419f915b625f4c4b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is a bubbly personality? 25 signs you might actually have it</span></p></a><p class=align-left>At 0 hours left, call them and tell them <i>"time's up". </i>Then you will reveal to them that the countdown was for nothing.</p><h3>24. Play them a song</h3><p class=align-left>This is one of the simplest call prank ideas. Pick a song you like, such as <i>Don't Stop Me Now</i>, by Queen. Then call someone and play the <a href=#>music</a> over your phone speaker without saying a word.</p><h3>25. An unanticipated conversation</h3><p class=align-left>In this prank, you will need to have two phones. Call two people randomly and put the phones on the loudspeaker. Allow them to converse as you sit to enjoy hearing them getting confused and annoyed.</p><h3>26. Is Tom there?</h3><p class=align-left>If you want to prank someone but don't know how, this prank should come in handy. Call a random number and ask for a random fake person. For instance, <i>"Is Tom there?"</i> When they tell you you have the wrong number, hang up. Then after a few hours, call them back with a disguised voice and ask again for the same fake person.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/51dcf84dd675f437.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is an exclusive relationship, and how should it work?</span></p></a><h3>27. Seek advice</h3><p class=align-left>This prank is ideal for a stranger or a <a href=#>business</a>. Call them and ask them for advice on an embarrassing topic. Some may hang up, while others will try to offer you advice.</p><h3>28. Fake crush</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c86ebb9222a9ef92.png><p class=align-left>Call someone you know and disguise your voice or use a second number they don't have. Inform them you are their secret admirer. Compliment them and make them feel comfortable while conversing with you. When they continue opening up, ask them if you can meet for the identity reveal.</p><h3>29. The job is done</h3><p class=align-left>This is one of the most hilarious prank-call ideas. Call one of your friends and disguise your voice, then say, <i>"The job is done. The body has been disposed of, and all the evidence cleared." </i>Then hang up, and you will definitely give them goosebumps.</p><h3>30. No one's home</h3><p class=align-left>This prank fits well for people who are dating but don't know where the other person lives. Simply call and tell them to come over and that no one is home. Give the address of a place whose door is always locked. To make it more humourous, stick a note at the door, <i>"I told you, no one's home."</i></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/39810c81fa79c47d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Funny quotes to lighten the mood for when the going gets tough</span></p></a><h3>31. The fake relative</h3><p class=align-left>Make a phone call to a random person and inform them that you are their relative, for example, a cousin. Inform them you have just landed at a local airport. Insist that they were to pick you up and that you are waiting for them. You will leave them trying to figure out who the relative could be.</p><h3>32. Take a deep breath</h3><p class=align-left>You can prank either a random person or a friend. It's simple, call them and when they pick up, take a deep breath and say nothing. Repeat this severally until they get irritated.</p><h3>33. Where do babies come from?</h3><p class=align-left>This trick is ideal for a business as, in most cases, companies take questions seriously. It will be more fun to disguise your voice to sound like a small child.</p><h3>34.
