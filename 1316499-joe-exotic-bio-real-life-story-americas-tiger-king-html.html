He was born in a family of four children and raised by parents who held a strong Christian background. However, when his father learned that Schreibvogel does not have a straight sexual orientation, he was infuriated. He forbade Joe from attending his funeral ceremony only because of his sexuality. Exotic's elder brother, Garold Wayne, accepted him and was involved in many businesses.</p><h2>Career</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9dc02415d248946e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Booboo Stewart?

Fortunately, in 2000, he purchased two tigers whom he named Tickles and Tess. The tigers reproduced and gave life to the current Zoo. The ambitious animal breeder buys horses and feeds them alive to the tigers. His passion for wildlife has inspired most of his followers on different social media platforms.

During the show, he appears to be a country song musician. However, according to some sources, the great secret behind Joe's songs is that he is not the writer. He asked Danny Clinton and Vince Johnson to be the writers and organize everything necessary for music production.</p><p class=align-left>Funny enough is that Exotic does not even know how to play guitar despite featuring in most songs holding a guitar. It is also disclosed that he is always lip-synching during the production of any song. He used <i>Her Kitty Kitty</i>, and <i>I Saw A Tiger</i> to throw insults at his rival, Baskin.</p><h2>Joe Exotic for president</h2><p class=align-left>The celebrated Tiger King has also been an influential politician in America. He is widely recognized as Joe Exotic for his political career. In 2016, he became an independent candidate running for the presidency as a Colorado resident. However, he got only 962 votes nationwide. He continued taking part in politics and contested for a gubernatorial seat in Oklahoma in 2018. The celebrity did not win after ranking the third with 664 votes.

When he was only five years, he was raped by an elder boy who created in him the desire to be sexually attractive to the same gender. He came to accept himself after realizing that it was difficult for him to rectify what had happened to him. His life has been challenging, especially after word went round that he is gay. Joe's family did not appreciate the fact that he publicized his sexuality, and they even rejected him. Living as an outcast has taught him the secrets of life in a hard way.</p><p class=align-left>He was first married to Brian Rhyne, who passed away in 2001 after contracting HIV/AIDS. Exotic suffered from depression with fear of victimization from the public that he was also suffering from the disease. Years after recovering from depression, he got engaged to John Finlay.

He did not survive the accident because some sources depict that he had carried a firearm. Joe, the animal breeder, was antagonized after the death of his second love partner. However, he overcame the situation in December 2017 after marrying Dillon Passage, his current partner. Joe Exotic wedding with Dillon was attended only by close friends and family. The couple seems to be enjoying the marriage life and managing the Zoo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/714b249f20c32ab2.jpg><h2>What about the Joe Schreibvogel scandal?</h2><p class=align-left>Tiger King's great ambition was to be more recognizable than his competitor Carole Baskin. This prompted him to change the name of his Zoo from G.W. Zoo to Big Cat Rescue Entertainment. However, Baskin was annoyed and planned to sue Joe Maldonado for his unfair competition. With the help of her spouse, they petitioned a case against Tiger King in court that cost Joe one million dollars. When he was declared bankrupt, Carole thought that it was an excellent opportunity to exploit him financially.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/647c4642065e539e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>All you need to know about Jason Sudeikis</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He had executed <a href=# title="Joe Exotic scandal" rel="nofollow noopener">plans of murdering</a> Baskin using an FBI informant who had hidden his identity. Furthermore, the informant learned that Exotic mistreated the animals by killing more than five tigers without any government permit. Hiring an FBI agent to undertake a murder case endangered his life, forcing him to suffer the consequences in court. During an interview at the Oklahoma City T.V. station, Exotic defended his decision to kill the tigers by saying:</p>I put five tigers to sleep because they were in pain. They were in pain. They had toenails coming out of their ankles. They had no teeth. They had exposed root canals.<h2>Facts about the Tiger King</h2><ul><li>Joe Exotic real name is Joe Schreibvogel.</li><li>In the year 1985, he tried to commit suicide.</li><li>Joe Exotic <a href=# title="Joe Exotic facts" rel="nofollow noopener">suffered from a leg</a> injury forcing him to use a walking stick to support his right leg.</li><li>He likes referring to himself as the gun-toting cowboy with a mullet gay to the public.</li><li>Schreibvogel's height is 5 feet 11 inches, and weight is 78kg.</li><li>The celebrity's name of the Zoo is in memorial of his long-gone brother, Garold Wayne.</li><li>He has over 14.6 thousand subscribers on his YouTube channel.</li><li>He used to wear four earrings in one year.</li><li>It is found that he shot two tigers in the head to make space for new ones.</li><li>He always used to wear a cowboy hat.</li><li>Joe loves guns, and when he was out of jail, he always carried a revolver with him.
