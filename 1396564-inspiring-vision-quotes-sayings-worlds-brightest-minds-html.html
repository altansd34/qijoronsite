Bennett</i></li><li>When I dare to be powerful, to use my strength in the service of my vision, then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. -<i>Audre Lorde</i></li><li>Don't let others tell you what you can't do. Don't let the limitations of others limit your vision. If you can remove your self-doubt and believe in yourself, you can achieve what you never thought possible. -<i>Roy T. Bennett</i></li><li>All human situations have their inconveniences. We feel those of the present but neither see nor feel those of the future, and hence we often make troublesome changes without amendment, and frequently for the worse. -<i>Benjamin Franklin</i></li><li>Don't underestimate the power of a vision. McDonald's founder, Ray Kroc, pictured his empire long before it existed, and he saw how to get there. He invented the company motto '<i>Quality, service, cleanliness and value'</i> and kept repeating it to employees for the rest of his life. -<i>Kenneth Labich</i></li><li>All men dream: but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dream with open eyes to make it possible. -<i>T.E. Lawrence</i></li><li>The companies that survive longest are the ones that work out what they uniquely can give to the world not just growth or money but their excellence, their respect for others, or their ability to make people happy. Some call those things a soul. -<i>Charles Handy</i></li><li>If you are working on something exciting that you really care about, you don't have to be pushed. The vision pulls you. -<i>Steve Jobs</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/24915bea936a3797.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Emotional moment final year student kneels down for boy who hawks "pure water" to sign on his shirt goes viral</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/24915bea936a3797.jpg><ul><li>The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps we must step up the stairs. -<i>Vance Havner</i></li><li>One effect of sustained conflict is to narrow our vision of what is possible. -<i>Nelson Mandela</i></li><li>A vision gives you a general direction for life while a process goal is part of the dream that you are accomplishing by taking specific actions today. -<i>Thomas Abreu</i></li><li>If you limit your choices only to what seems possible or reasonable, you disconnect yourself from what you truly want, and all that is left is a compromise. -<i>Robert Fritz</i></li><li>If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel's heartbeat, and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence. - <i>George Eliot</i></li><li>Some visionaries foresee an economy based entirely on giving. That would be the ideal way to heal the excesses of unfettered capitalism (and many other woes), but the basis for universal giving can only be expansion beyond our present sense of self. - <i>Deepak Chopra</i></li><li>It doesn't matter how fast you can go, it doesn't matter how much passion you have, and it doesn't matter how much energy you put into something. If you don't have a vision and clarity on the destination you want to reach, you'll never get there. - <i>Dean Graziosi</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2793a49600de26c6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sign her already: Reactions as 18-year-old Nigerian lady dribbles men on football pitch in viral video</span></p></a><h2>Inner vision quotes</h2><p class=align-left>Each inner quote about vision is about having an imagination and seeing clearly how you want things to be done.</p><p class=align-left>Once you have realized your inner vision, then it is time to make it clear and definite.
