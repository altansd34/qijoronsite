They tried several ways to&nbsp;improve the situation, but nothing worked. The engine surges continued. And just over a&nbsp;minute into the flight, when the plane reached 3,000&nbsp;feet, both engines failed: first, the right one; two seconds later, the left one. The pilots decided to&nbsp;return to&nbsp;the <a href=# title=airport data-link=tag>airport</a> they had just left. At&nbsp;the same time, they tried to&nbsp;restart the engines. Nothing seemed to&nbsp;work. The flight crew made a&nbsp;decision to&nbsp;pitch the plane down and then level it&nbsp;off. Perhaps it&nbsp;could help them gain some speed for the glide! But soon, they realized they wouldn’t make it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the airport. Was the plane going to&nbsp;crash?! That’s when the Miracle at&nbsp;Gottröra occurred.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3eb/0b4/dafd885ef0b45400c60a07a94f.png><p>The morning before the flight started as&nbsp;usual. Regular pre-flight procedures. Good weather. The members of&nbsp;the flight crew were experienced pilots: a&nbsp;44-year-old Danish captain with over 8,000 flight hours under his belt and a&nbsp;34-year-old first officer from Sweden with 3,000&nbsp;hours. So, what could go&nbsp;wrong? The plane itself was almost brand-new. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;McDonnell Douglas MD-81 nicknamed Dana Viking. It&nbsp;made its first flight on&nbsp;March&nbsp;16, 1991. By&nbsp;that fateful day, the aircraft had been in&nbsp;service for a&nbsp;mere 9&nbsp;months. There were 122 passengers and 7&nbsp;crew members on&nbsp;board. Flight 751 Scandinavian Airlines was a&nbsp;scheduled flight from Stockholm, Sweden, to&nbsp;Warsaw, Poland. On&nbsp;the way, the plane was supposed to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;stop in&nbsp;Copenhagen, Denmark.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/695/08d/f8fcb85db9b2934b7fe7bac438.png><p>The aircraft took off from Stockholm according to&nbsp;its schedule&nbsp;— at&nbsp;08:47&nbsp;AM local time. But by&nbsp;that point, the people inside had already been doomed. All because of&nbsp;a&nbsp;terrible sequence of&nbsp;events before the departure. It&nbsp;started the night before. The plane arrived at&nbsp;Stockholm Airport after a&nbsp;flight from Zurich. It&nbsp;was 10:09&nbsp;PM. The aircraft spent the night at&nbsp;the gate outside. It&nbsp;was cold&nbsp;— the temperatures dropped to&nbsp;34˚F&nbsp;— just above freezing. What made the situation even worse was that almost 6,000 lbs of&nbsp;freezing-cold fuel, chilled during the flight, still remained in&nbsp;the tanks located in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=wings data-link=tag>wings</a>. The fuel was so&nbsp;cold because the plane had been flying at&nbsp;the cruising altitude, where the air temperature outside the cabin varied from −61 to −80˚F. The flight from Zurich lasted around 1&nbsp;hour and 40&nbsp;minutes.</p><p>Soon after midnight, a&nbsp;flight technician came to&nbsp;check on&nbsp;the aircraft. The man had to&nbsp;remove some slush from the landing gear. Otherwise, he&nbsp;wouldn’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;examine&nbsp;it. At&nbsp;around 2&nbsp;AM, when he&nbsp;was leaving, he&nbsp;noticed some <a href=# title=ice data-link=tag>ice</a> covering the upper part of&nbsp;the wings. By&nbsp;the morning, the situation had become even direr: a&nbsp;layer of&nbsp;clear, almost invisible ice had formed on&nbsp;the tops of&nbsp;the wings. The plane <u>h</u>ad to&nbsp;leave the gate at&nbsp;around 08:30&nbsp;AM. An&nbsp;hour before the departure, the mechanic responsible for the plane noticed that some ice covered the underside of&nbsp;the wings. He&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;make sure there was no&nbsp;ice on&nbsp;the tops of&nbsp;the wings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/295/7ac/caba7459cca29c0c7cb07ad4d6.png><p>He&nbsp;climbed a&nbsp;ladder and put one knee on&nbsp;the wing. Then he&nbsp;bent forward to&nbsp;touch the front part of&nbsp;the wing. There was no&nbsp;ice, just some slush. The mechanic decided to&nbsp;make sure everything was fine with the air inlet of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the engines&nbsp;— he&nbsp;didn’t find anything abnormal. Soon after that, the personnel used more than 220 gallons of&nbsp;de-icing fluid to&nbsp;remove ice from the plane. The mechanic consulted with the captain of&nbsp;the aircraft and ordered the staff to&nbsp;de-ice the underside of&nbsp;the wings as&nbsp;well. After all, he&nbsp;HAD seen some ice there. But no&nbsp;one thought to&nbsp;double-check if&nbsp;there was clear ice on&nbsp;the tops of&nbsp;the wings. After they had finished the procedure, the mechanic reported to&nbsp;the captain, “We’re done here. De-icing finished. There was a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;snow and ice, but everything’s clear now.” The captain thanked the mechanic and carried on&nbsp;with the pre-flight procedures.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b4d/ca8/5e621155f1892d78c04031326e.png><p>The plane taxied to&nbsp;the runway. Its engines’ anti-ice systems were switched on&nbsp;and didn’t show any malfunction. But several passengers later claimed they had seen ice sliding off the upper side of&nbsp;the wings while the plane had been taking off. And still, the plane left the ground and headed for Stockholm as&nbsp;usual. But shortly after the takeoff, several pieces of&nbsp;the overlooked ice broke off. At&nbsp;full speed, they slammed into the fans of&nbsp;the engines near the tail on&nbsp;both sides of&nbsp;the plane, ruining the blades. It&nbsp;led to&nbsp;a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;surges. And the rest is&nbsp;history. Meanwhile, somewhere in&nbsp;the cabin, Scandinavian Airlines Flight Captain Per Holmberg, who was on&nbsp;board as&nbsp;a&nbsp;passenger, noticed something was amiss. At&nbsp;first, he&nbsp;informed the flight attendant sitting in&nbsp;the rear jump seat that the right engine was surging. She tried to&nbsp;contact the flight crew&nbsp;— unsuccessfully.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/029/518/f48323592d92283eff4cd96afc.png><p>Then the ununiformed captain rushed to&nbsp;the cockpit and asked if&nbsp;he&nbsp;could help the pilots. The first officer gave him the emergency checklist, and the captain asked him to&nbsp;start the auxiliary power unit (a&nbsp;small gas turbine in&nbsp;the tail of&nbsp;the plane). Holmberg’s advice and help were invaluable, but was it&nbsp;enough to&nbsp;save the plane and the people inside? When the plane emerged from the cloud cover at&nbsp;an&nbsp;altitude of&nbsp;890&nbsp;ft, the pilots realized they wouldn’t have enough time to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;back to&nbsp;the airport. An&nbsp;immediate emergency landing was unavoidable. The assisting captain passed the order to&nbsp;the cabin crew, and they started preparing the passengers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/05e/7ec/be62335312b6b1f77c8bc1f8dc.png><p>There was a&nbsp;large field to&nbsp;the north of&nbsp;the plane. But the captain realized they didn’t have enough time to&nbsp;reach&nbsp;it. So&nbsp;he&nbsp;chose a&nbsp;much smaller field in&nbsp;a&nbsp;forested area in&nbsp;the direction of&nbsp;flight. It&nbsp;was not far from the village of&nbsp;Gottröra in&nbsp;Uppland, Sweden. The plane was just 1,0&nbsp;ft above the ground when the assisting captain started extending the flaps. At&nbsp;the height of&nbsp;183&nbsp;feet, the captain reported to&nbsp;Stockholm control, “We’re crashing to&nbsp;the ground.” Seven seconds later, the plane hit several trees and lost a&nbsp;huge chunk of&nbsp;its right wing. By&nbsp;that time, the landing gear had already been extended, and the speed had decreased to&nbsp;139&nbsp;mph. Moments later, the plane’s tail struck the ground and broke off. The aircraft kept sliding across the field still at&nbsp;high speed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d65/f20/264d2e50e8a3b97b53b0b47743.png><p>It&nbsp;traveled 360&nbsp;feet, with its main landing gear leaving marks on&nbsp;the field. At&nbsp;one point, the plane lost the main and nose landing gear. Its fuselage broke into three parts. Miraculously, there was no&nbsp;fire. If&nbsp;you look at&nbsp;the pictures from the crash site&nbsp;— the plane torn into pieces, with its parts scattered across the field&nbsp;— it’s hard to&nbsp;believe that all 129 people on&nbsp;board the plane survived! It&nbsp;seems like a&nbsp;miracle. But it&nbsp;was also thanks to&nbsp;the flight attendants’ quick reaction and the correct instructions they gave the passengers. They didn’t panic and told the people to&nbsp;adopt the brace position just in&nbsp;time to&nbsp;avoid fatalities. Even more surprising, almost all passengers, except for four people, made their way out of&nbsp;the plane on&nbsp;their own! No&nbsp;wonder this accident got nicknamed “the miracle.”</p><p>The aircraft, though, wasn’t as&nbsp;lucky. The 9-month-old plane was damaged so&nbsp;badly that it&nbsp;was an&nbsp;immediate write-off. Everyone praised the actions of&nbsp;the flight crew. The landing was incredibly skilled&nbsp;— especially in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;fast-developing, very dangerous situation. The captain himself admitted that few pilots were ever forced to&nbsp;put to&nbsp;the test the skills they got during training&nbsp;— at&nbsp;least, not to&nbsp;this degree. He&nbsp;said he&nbsp;was proud of&nbsp;his crew and relieved that everyone had survived. And... he&nbsp;never returned to&nbsp;piloting commercial planes.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZL2trc2eZK2gkal6ra3NnZydZaeewal5zqejsmWfo7Juw8innmZwYWh%2BdoOO</p></div><div id=links><a href=./adventure-activities.html>&#171;&nbsp;Preparing for Adventure | Wales.com</a>
