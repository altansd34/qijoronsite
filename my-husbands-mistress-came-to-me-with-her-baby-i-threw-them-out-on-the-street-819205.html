But when the woman he had an affair with shows up at your door with their baby, the situation escalates to a whole new level. And that's exactly what happened in today's story.</p><p>My common law<strong> </strong>husband and I, 40f and 41m, have been together for 10 years and I consider those years to be very loving and happy, but apparently not for him since he had a side piece.</p><p>I make furniture and make around €1M a year. My husband is a teacher. It goes without saying that I provide for us. I don’t ask what he does with his salary. We live way below our means however because we are both minimalists, but we have a big house, nice cars, and lots of art. Everything is mine, however.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/310/0bf/4aad785f5986b36aaa23fcfc46.jpg><p>Apparently, he met his side piece (f25) under false pretenses and told her that we were legally married, so he owned 1/2 my company and everything else I own. When she got pregnant, he started spending his salary on her (I wasn’t alarmed because I didn’t know what he did with his money). Now he is in Dubai on vacation and her lease on her apartment expired, so she just showed up at my door with her baby.</p><p>She told me she was his girlfriend and that he was getting a <a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a>, so she might as well live in his house and I could live in a hotel because I could afford it. She didn’t have any money or home. She literally refused to step out, so I called the police and locked myself in the greenhouse.</p><p>When the police came, she was literally unpacking the child’s clothes in the living area. They escorted her out. I was very shaken. Later I found out all the details I included above.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/958/67d/4d68e6573ab7597cf40c7aa22b.jpg><p>My husband’s mother thought I was a jerk for kicking out a little baby on the street. That was her only grandson. I used my money and power to control everything around me.</p><p>But honestly, teachers make 60k a year so as I found out later, he gave her his salary. I can’t understand why she would be so homeless and destitute. She had big designer bags, a designer stroller, and Van Cleef& Arpels jewelry when she showed up at my home. But now I am a jerk?</p><p><h2>People stood on&nbsp;her side.</h2></p><ul><li>"Pack his things and put them in the front yard when you know he’s landed and is on his way to the house, and let his mommy know to come get her cheating son from your house." <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Lower-Recover2011 / Reddit</a></li><li>"If your mother-in-law is so concerned about the baby, she can take them in." <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>M***erhornet212 / Reddit</a></li><li>"Imagine going to someone else house and telling that person that they can go to live in a hotel.
