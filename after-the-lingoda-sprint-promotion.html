Read on to discover what you could achieve after the Lingoda Language Sprint.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Join the Lingoda Sprint</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How can you increase your language learning motivation?</h2><p>We&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">applied the concept of a Sprint to language learning</a>.&nbsp;And, rather than leaving the planning and preparations to you, we have taken control and challenge you to choose between&nbsp;<strong>taking 15 or 30 lessons a month for two months</strong>, after which your fluency and confidence in your chosen language will drastically improve.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What you’ll achieve after the Lingoda Sprint</h2><p>Most people discover they can reach their goals much more easily under the pressure of commitment, accountability and the possibility of a prize at the end.</p><p>The promise of a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">50 % cashback reward</a> or class credits for an even higher value after successfully completing the Sprint and the fact that you are given a deadline, and the pressure of having to show up every day is motivating.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ten things you’ll be able to do after you cross the Sprint finish line</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. You will actually be able to speak your chosen language</h3><p>In the past, we’ve talked about the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">benefits of learning with a teacher</a>&nbsp;rather than language apps, the biggest advantage being that…you&nbsp;<strong>get to speak</strong>. The Sprint gives you the opportunity to take classes with other students and a teacher who is there to encourage you to produce speech from day one.</p><p>After your first lesson you will already have spoken several times in your new favourite language!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. You will prove you are confident</h3><p>Everyone can&nbsp;claim&nbsp;they’re confident. But not everybody has the guts to show up, speak with strangers, learn from a native-level teacher and step out of their comfort zone. Your completed Sprint will be proof that you have it in you. It’s not about never having doubts or&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">never feeling nervous</a>&nbsp;about your performance – it’s about having the integrity, the passion and the discipline to be present and get things done!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. You will travel like you mean it</h3><p>Let’s face it: having to check&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Translate</a>&nbsp;every 5 minutes, struggling to pronounce basic words and suffering through awkward silences with the hotel receptionist is not really what you had in mind for your dream vacation.&nbsp;After the Sprint, you will have practiced several common phrases, learned essential keywords and improved your&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pronunciation</a>. Time to shine on your next trip!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. You will dare to go for that job</h3><p>Many sprint students are&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">job seekers who want to take their career to the next level</a>&nbsp;and succeed. Even if you feel your fluency isn’t perfect, the fact that you’ve been trying to learn, getting yourself out there, taking classes with native-level teachers, and embarrassing yourself once in a while will give your employer a clue as to who you are and who you’re striving to become. After all, Sprinters are for those who persist, battle and practice!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Join the Lingoda Sprint</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. You will impress others with your organisational skills</h3><p>Making sure that you keep showing up for class every single day, even though unexpected appointments, family gatherings, weddings, power outages and birthday parties sometimes get “in the way”. Committing to completing a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">language sprint</a>&nbsp;requires strong organisational skills, as you start taking your learning seriously, take a hard look at your schedule and realise your learning has to become a priority. Which leads us to…</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>6. You will value your “me-time” more</h3><p>Lingoda classes take place 24/7. That means you can book your lessons at midnight, 3am, or noon. It’s a unique opportunity to take your schedule in your own hands. Above all else, it shows you that being busy with family, work or college doesn’t mean you have to give up on your individual needs – if you want to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">learn</a>, we’re right here for you! After the Sprint, making time for the things you love should feel like a breeze, as you’ve proved to yourself it is totally possible.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>7. You will show loved ones you care</h3><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Learning a new language</a>&nbsp;– especially that of your current partner, your family members or your best friends – is a way of connecting at a deeper level and showing others that you care about their upbringing,&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">culture</a></strong>, heritage and well-being.&nbsp;If that isn’t showing some love…a language Sprint certainly is, especially when you manage to send a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">romantic</a>&nbsp;or endearing text effortlessly!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>8. You will chase goals with a new tool under your belt</h3><p>From&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">successful artists looking for their next qualification</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">culture aficionados who want to experience a new city</a>,&nbsp;you shouldn’t have to postpone your objectives because of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">language barriers</a>. Quite the opposite – it is your duty to minimise them as soon as possible! The Sprint is a quick way to give fluency a boost and have a new language tool right under your belt before taking the next step towards your future, whether that means moving abroad, getting your next degree or finally being able to communicate with your partner’s family in their mother tongue.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>9. You’ll have a brain that just does it better</h3><p>Your brain will benefit from consistent language learning more than you might expect…starting with its size. That’s right – learning a second language can actually&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">make your brain bigger</a>!&nbsp;Language learning is also known to help you&nbsp;score better at other unrelated tests,<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">help slow down the mental decline</a>&nbsp;that comes with ageing, stave off&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dementia for up to 5 years</a>,&nbsp;and even influence your&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">decision-making</a>&nbsp;skills. And the best part? Contrary to popular belief,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">these benefits will come regardless of how old you are</a>&nbsp;when you start learning your new language. Your brain will get a boost in any case. Speaking of which…</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>10. You’ll feel the benefits for a long, long time</h3><p>If you thought you would benefit from the Sprint only for its duration, think again! After completing your studies, you’ll realise how many doors have opened for you with only 3 months of exposure to your new language. You’ll be able to understand&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">song lyrics</a>&nbsp;better.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Movie&nbsp;</a>subtitles will feel lame once you start getting most of what you hear. You’ll suddenly start participating in conversations other people are having on social media or on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a>&nbsp;videos. So…will you really let that tiny bit of discomfort stop you? We don’t think so!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Join the Lingoda Sprint</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lingoda-2020-favicon.png><h2>Maria Inês Teixeira</h2><p>Maria Inês has been working as a language teacher and blogger for more than 2 years.
