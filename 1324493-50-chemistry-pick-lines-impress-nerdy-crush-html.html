Here are a few examples.</p><ul><li>You must be a compound of barium and beryllium because you are a total babe. You complete my world and make the perfect partner for all my needs.</li><li>You and I have such great chemistry together. Let us try to do some biology together too. We have everything going for us only if you could see what I am seeing in us.</li><li>Your body must be made of oxygen and neon because you are the one. You are what I have been looking for because you fit my every need.</li><li>You must be hydrochloric acid because you are making my limestone fizz. I cannot look at you without blushing because you make everything thing seem like its floating all around me.</li><li>You are a photon quantum to my valence electron because you excite me to a higher energy level. No one has such power over my life, which is why I do not want to let you go.</li><li>I am so strongly attracted to you; scientists will have to discover a fifth fundamental force. You are strong enough to push people to get to work.</li><li>Scientists have recently discovered a rare new element called Beautium… It looks like you are made of it. Your looks make you stand out.</li><li>Baby, every time I see you, my cardiovascular system gets all worked up.

That is how magical you are!</li><li>Baby, if you let me pump my H+ ions into your inter-membrane space, it would induce a massive conformational change in my f1 complex.</li><li>I wish your name was Avogadro because then I would already know your number. For now, it would be great if you shared them with me for a later engagement.</li><li>Are you full of Beryllium, Gold, and Titanium? Because you are Be-Au-Ti-Ful.

You will be surprised at the beast that will be unleashed.</li><li>Everyone knows its not the size of the vector that matters, but the way the force is delivered. You bet I have a strong force that speaks for itself.</li><li>How about we slip between my beta-pleated sheets and you get to know my alpha-helix? You can only find how fierce I am if you are willing to try.</li><li>Are you a non-volatile particle? Because you raise my boiling point to levels that no one can</li><li>Are you an alpha carbon? Because you look susceptible to backside attack! You are strongly endowed, and no one can argue with facts that are open for all to see.</li><li>Are you a charged atom? Because I have got my ion you. No matter how I try to look aside, my eyes still drift and find themselves glued to you.</li><li>You are hotter than sulfur hydroxide mixed with ethyl acetate.
