Although their persistence is admirable, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">some people who do not blow the judges away</a> with their auditions refuse to leave the stage.</strong></p><p>It happens on every series no matter where they take place. Contestants on talent shows like The X Factor UK, Britain’s Got Talent, and more choose to beg, plead, and cry to get their way with the judges. While their tactics normally never work, you have to admit it’s pretty entertaining to watch. Here’s five times a contestant refused to leave the stage or judging room.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Eskimo Blonde</h2><p>Girl trio <a href=#>Eskimo Blonde</a> returned to The X Factor UK for redemption in 2006. During their original audition, they were told that lead singer Hari had the best voice out of the girls in the group. The band replaced Hari with a new member and auditioned with a Spice Girls song. The judges were not impressed.</p><p>Eskimo Blonde had seen their old group member Hari before their audition, so they didn’t want to take no for an answer. Hari auditioned as a solo artist and made it through to the next round. The Eskimo Blonde girls begged the judges to reconsider the three “no’s” from the judges. Simon Cowell and Louis Walsh got fed up and left the room while Sharon Osbourne dealt with their heartbreak. Eventually, security had to escort them out of the audition room as they cried and refused to leave.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Mal Ford</h2><p>This 74-year-old man had a huge personality, but the Britain’s Got Talent judges immediately hit their red buzzers for his music act. Even though Mal Ford had tons of energy, the judges didn’t find his talent as anything special. Instead of stopping the performance, Mal decided to completely ignore the judge’s reaction. Even the hosts of the show tried to get him off the stage, yet he continued to perform.</p><p>Eventually, the audience began laughing and clapping along with Mal’s act. He started another song before leaving the stage! The audience and judges continued to laugh. They even got on their feet as he took a bow. In the end, the judges jokingly changed their mind and decided to push Mal into the next round of the competition. This wasn’t an aggressive contestant at all, but it was quite funny that he didn’t want to stop the show.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Pat Ford</h2><p>I fully believe that Pat Ford only auditioned for The X Factor because he wanted to get the attention of Britney Spears. He showed up to the audition with a bouquet of flowers and had previously mentioned that he wanted Spears to be his girlfriend in his biography package. As if his love for Spears wasn’t enough, he decided to sing “Circus” as his audition song.</p><p>The audience began booing Pat half way through his performance, until Cowell stopped him. After receiving four “no’s” from the judges he continued to stand on stage and stare at the judge. Each of the judges seemed to be freaked out by his on stage antics. Pat asked if he could give his flowers to Spears and Cowell said he would come get them and give them to her. Ford was very emotional when he finally left the building, even refusing to talk to the production team.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGwXtmcIsYQ</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Jocelyn Hinton</h2><p>This 34-year-old took the stage with the X Factor stage with pride in 2013. For her audition she sang “Firework” by Katy Perry. Her audition went well until she forgot the words and seemed frustrated with herself. Eventually, Cowell stopped her performance.</p><p>Jocelyn began singing another song as the judges began giving her critiques. Judge Demi Lovato asked her to stop, but Jocelyn began yet another song. The audience continued laughing at her efforts, but she kept begging and pleading to continue in the competition. She promised Cowell that she was in fact a good singer, but he couldn’t handle her singing anymore. He proceeded to escort her off stage.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nd5FcZ_7v0</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. Michael Lewis</h2><p>In his first X Factor UK audition, Michael Lewis, impersonated his idol, Michael Jackson. He got bad reviews from the judges and returned to the stage a year later as himself. He promised no gimmicks in his 2011 X Factor audition and he was immediately given sour looks by the judges.</p><p>Once again the judges weren’t a fan of the performance. While receiving “no’s” from the judges, Michael proceeded to lay on the stage. He then accused the judges of judging him before he even began singing. Michael was visibly upset, but finally took no for an answer as he left the stage.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>What’s one thing five of these onstage meltdowns had in common? <a aria-label="Simon Cowell witnessed almost all of them as a judge (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cowell witnessed</a> almost all of them!</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Michael-Ketterer.jpg alt="8 Things About ‘AGT’s Golden Buzzer Father of 6, Michael Ketterer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57lGamm6afrbawwdJmmqimpJrAta3Nrapmr5ikerOxxa6qnpxdqbxuuMSarZ5lpJa5prrTZqqhp6diwLWtxp6qaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./are-verbs-italian.html>&#171;&nbsp;97 -are verbs in Italian</a>
