At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;16, she left <a href=#>school</a> and started working as&nbsp;a&nbsp;secretary in&nbsp;an&nbsp;American company branch office. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;the anti-American protests, the office was destroyed and she even has a&nbsp;scar on&nbsp;her face to&nbsp;this day as&nbsp;a&nbsp;reminder of&nbsp;those events.</p><p>Because living in&nbsp;her homeland was hard, Shakira’s only goal was leaving the country. Taking <a href=# title=part data-link=tag>part</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;beauty contest gave her that chance. When she won the title of&nbsp;“Miss Guyana,” she went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;compete in&nbsp;the “Miss World” competition in&nbsp;1967 where she won <a href=#>third place</a>.</p><p>Shakira Baksh (on&nbsp;the left) at&nbsp;the “Miss World” competition, 1967</p><p>Participating in&nbsp;“Miss World” was the beginning of&nbsp;her international career as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model and gave her a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;<a href=# title=London data-link=tag>London</a>. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, she appeared in&nbsp;the advertisement that Michael Caine initially saw her&nbsp;in.</p><p><h2>Michael Caine’s life before he&nbsp;met Shakira</h2></p><p>Michael Caine, 1965</p><p>The first 10&nbsp;years of&nbsp;Michael Caine’s career were <a href=#>tough</a> and as&nbsp;he&nbsp;said himself, they were more like purgatory than heaven. During that period, he&nbsp;met his first wife, actress Patricia Haines.</p><p>Michael remembers going through a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;destructive things that were hard on&nbsp;his soul. He&nbsp;did the dishes at&nbsp;a&nbsp;restaurant, worked at&nbsp;a&nbsp;laundromat, and was a&nbsp;plumber’s assistant. He&nbsp;landed some small acting roles but they were few and far between. He&nbsp;thought that Patricia was more talented and she had more of&nbsp;a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;become successful in&nbsp;the film industry.</p><p>7&nbsp;years later, the <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> fell apart. <a href=#>According to&nbsp;Michael</a>, he&nbsp;was too young and immature to&nbsp;deal with his poverty and personal and professional failures. 2&nbsp;years later, he&nbsp;continued to&nbsp;do&nbsp;movies, and played the part of&nbsp;an&nbsp;aristocrat lieutenant in&nbsp;Zulus which ultimately made him famous. And nine years after his divorce in&nbsp;1971, Michael met the woman he&nbsp;was supposed to&nbsp;live the biggest part of&nbsp;his life with.</p><p><h2>They met each other thanks to&nbsp;an&nbsp;ad.</h2></p><p>Michael Caine described the evening in&nbsp;which he&nbsp;saw his future wife for the first time in&nbsp;his <a href=#>autobiography</a>. He&nbsp;and his friend Paul were watching a&nbsp;show on&nbsp;TV when they saw an&nbsp;ad&nbsp;for Maxwell House and Michael was already reaching for the remote when something caught his attention.</p><p>In&nbsp;the background, there was a&nbsp;girl dancing and he&nbsp;just couldn’t take his eyes off of&nbsp;her. The actor remembers, “My&nbsp;heart started pounding and my&nbsp;palms became sweaty.” When her face was shown in&nbsp;a&nbsp;close-up, Michael sat in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV on&nbsp;his knees in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;see her better.</p><p>Confused, Paul asked, “What’s up&nbsp;with you?”</p><p>Michael said, “This girl is&nbsp;amazing.”</p><p>Paul said, “I&nbsp;know. Now what?”</p><p>The actor then said, “I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;meet her.” When Paul said she lived in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Brazil data-link=tag>Brazil</a>, Michael asked him if&nbsp;he&nbsp;would travel with him to&nbsp;see her. Paul simply responded, “You’re mad, pal.” In&nbsp;the end, Michael convinced his friend and they got on&nbsp;the earliest flight.</p><p>Michael planned to&nbsp;call the Maxwell House office in&nbsp;the morning to&nbsp;find out who did the commercial for them. But he&nbsp;couldn’t relax or&nbsp;calm down, so&nbsp;they went to&nbsp;a&nbsp;bar. When Michael was going to&nbsp;leave, a&nbsp;guy he&nbsp;knew came up&nbsp;to&nbsp;him and the actor told him he&nbsp;had fallen in&nbsp;love.</p><p>When asked who the girl was, Michael <a href=#>said</a>, “The girl&nbsp;I saw on&nbsp;TV tonight.” It&nbsp;turned out that this guy from the bar worked for the company that shot the commercial. This was a&nbsp;stroke of&nbsp;great luck.</p><p>After Michael said that he&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;Brazil looking for the girl, the guys just started laughing. It&nbsp;turned out that the model wasn’t from Brazil but rather, she was from British Guiana (today, it’s Guyana in&nbsp;South America) but she lived and worked in&nbsp;London.</p><p>Michael called his future wife 11&nbsp;times and she said <a href=#>no</a>&nbsp;until she finally agreed to&nbsp;meet him. “I&nbsp;fell in&nbsp;love with her in&nbsp;about 8&nbsp;minutes and it&nbsp;took her 2&nbsp;hours to&nbsp;love me&nbsp;back,” the actor <a href=#>remembers</a>.</p><p>Shakira <a href=#>remembers</a> that Michael turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;completely different from what she expected. He&nbsp;looked very aggressive in&nbsp;the movies but in&nbsp;real life, he&nbsp;was charming and very soft&nbsp;— the kind of&nbsp;person she wanted to&nbsp;spend a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;her life with.</p><p><h2>How Shakira influenced the actor’s life</h2></p><p class=adme-img-description>Michael’s and Shakira’s wedding, 1973</p><p>When they met, Michael drank a&nbsp;bottle of&nbsp;vodka and smoked several packs of&nbsp;cigarettes a&nbsp;day. According to&nbsp;the actor, he&nbsp;would have drunk himself to&nbsp;death if&nbsp;it&nbsp;weren’t for Shakira. “<a href=#>She didn’t tell</a> me&nbsp;to&nbsp;give up&nbsp;drinking, I&nbsp;just wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;sober and alive with her.” Since then, he’s only been able to&nbsp;drink a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;wine during dinner. 2&nbsp;years after they met, they got married and in&nbsp;1973, they had their daughter, Natasha.</p><p class=adme-img-description>The Caines with their daughter Natasha, 1998</p><p>Shakira was always the person Michael wanted to&nbsp;come home to&nbsp;as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;possible&nbsp;— he&nbsp;felt like a&nbsp;real family man with her. “I&nbsp;just love to&nbsp;go&nbsp;<a href=#>home</a>, no&nbsp;matter where I&nbsp;am, the most luxurious hotel suite in&nbsp;the world, I&nbsp;love to&nbsp;go&nbsp;home.”</p><p><h2>Michael Caine with his wife after receiving the Order of Arts and Letters in France, 2011</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aaa/d6a/e7548b590fa2f6a9d5dbf085a8.jpg><p>Michael Caine won several awards and earned the title of&nbsp;Knight. Shakira did films and TV-series but at&nbsp;some point, she left her career to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;travel with her husband when he&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;work. For Michael, this prevented them from drifting apart and helped them keep their family together.

When they met each other, nobody could believe they would build such a&nbsp;strong family. Caine’s friends thought he&nbsp;was mad because he&nbsp;saw an&nbsp;attractive girl in&nbsp;an&nbsp;ad, felt it&nbsp;was his person, and was ready to&nbsp;do&nbsp;anything to&nbsp;find her. And he&nbsp;was right: Shakira made his life calm and harmonious&nbsp;— and it&nbsp;was exactly what he&nbsp;needed.</p><p><h2>Michael and Shakira Caine, 2017</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b8a/c22/68742351fca6b598662b20d988.jpg><p>This photo was taken in&nbsp;2019.
