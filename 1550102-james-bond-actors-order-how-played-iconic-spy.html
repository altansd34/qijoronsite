The book's author did not support this choice, but the actor gave an outstanding performance. His character differs from the books as he is cold-hearted and promiscuous. Connery is one of the fan favourites, and many consider him the best 007 due to his Scottish brogue, sophisticated demeanour, and rugged looks.</p><p class=align-left>Connery starred as James Bond in seven films. They included <i>Dr No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice, Diamonds Are Forever,</i> and <i>Never Say Never Again</i> (non-official film).</p><p class=align-left>Sean had a successful and long acting career spanning several decades. He played other roles outside the Bond movies, such as <i>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, The Hunt for Red October, </i>and <i>The Rock</i>. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Connery won</a> an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in <i>The Rock</i>.

Before playing Agent 007, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">George Lazenby</a> appeared in a few TV commercials and a brief role on <i>Gideon's Way.</i></p><p class=align-left>Lazenby's characterisation leaned more towards the emotional aspect and growth of the character. The Australian actor brought charm and swagger to the spy.</p><p class=align-left>His inexperience in acting led to mixed feelings from the viewers. This resulted in the decision not to bring him back for the role. It was not all gloomy for Lazenby as he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year.</p><h3>3. Roger Moore (1973–1985)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ca0f47e5e3e9cde2.jpg><p class=align-left>Roger Moore is a famous English actor who played the M16 agent in seven movies between 1973 and 1985.

Dalton's portrayal leaned more towards a serious, reflective character with loyalty and moral issues.</p><p class=align-left>Before playing the M16 spy, Dalton had appeared in films like <i>The Lion in Winter</i> and <i>Flash Gordon. </i>He would have made it for the third film were it not for the legal battle on the Bond catalogue.
