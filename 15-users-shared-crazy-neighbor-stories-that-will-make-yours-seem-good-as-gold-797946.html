Anytime I&nbsp;took my&nbsp;dog out on&nbsp;a&nbsp;leash and we&nbsp;ran into him, he&nbsp;would be&nbsp;on&nbsp;his knees, petting and talking to&nbsp;the dog. The first dozen or&nbsp;so&nbsp;times we&nbsp;ran into this guy, I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;make polite small talk (“Oh&nbsp;wow, he&nbsp;loves you! I’m [name] by&nbsp;the way.”) and he&nbsp;just flatly ignored&nbsp;me. In&nbsp;probably over a&nbsp;hundred interactions, he&nbsp;never once spoke to&nbsp;me&nbsp;or&nbsp;looked at&nbsp;me. For a&nbsp;while, I&nbsp;assumed he&nbsp;was deaf or&nbsp;hard of&nbsp;hearing and a&nbsp;bit socially awkward. But then&nbsp;I happened to&nbsp;walk outside one day while my&nbsp;partner was taking the dog out and saw my&nbsp;partner and the neighbor having a&nbsp;perfectly friendly chat! I&nbsp;walked up&nbsp;to&nbsp;join them, my&nbsp;partner greeted&nbsp;me, and the neighbor ignored me&nbsp;exactly as&nbsp;usual. The whole thing was as&nbsp;awkward as&nbsp;could&nbsp;be, but at&nbsp;least the dude was nice to&nbsp;my&nbsp;dog. <a href=#>@awarmlightforall</a></li><li readability=10.86095505618><p>My&nbsp;dad had a&nbsp;neighbor that played his radio loudly all day, even when he&nbsp;wasn’t home or&nbsp;was gone on&nbsp;vacation. Every time he&nbsp;left the house and his radio was still&nbsp;on, my&nbsp;dad would go&nbsp;and trip the circuit breaker to&nbsp;his condo. One day he&nbsp;sees my&nbsp;dad, who was an&nbsp;electrical engineer, and asked him why his breaker kept tripping&nbsp;— was it&nbsp;faulty wiring? No, my&nbsp;dad explained, the loud radio was probably just putting too much strain on&nbsp;the circuit because it&nbsp;was left on&nbsp;all the time. My&nbsp;dad suggested that he&nbsp;should try turning it&nbsp;down or&nbsp;off when he&nbsp;wasn’t home, and see if&nbsp;that fixed&nbsp;it. So&nbsp;the man tried&nbsp;it, and surprise surprise, the circuit breaker stopped tripping! <a href=#>@TheFeshy</a></p></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/595/ed6/0d905351b0a9f090689d5a5893.jpg><ul readability=0.49034620505992><li>Had another single condo owner in&nbsp;my&nbsp;development (so&nbsp;we&nbsp;both had extra bedrooms). She was pleasant, but&nbsp;I was surprised when she invited me&nbsp;to&nbsp;come see her “collection.” Okay.<br>We&nbsp;went upstairs and she opened the door to&nbsp;her small extra bedroom... and it&nbsp;was clowns. Clown dolls, clown busts, clown velvet paintings, clown toys&nbsp;— more clown crap than&nbsp;I knew existed. All I&nbsp;could think of&nbsp;was the number of&nbsp;people who would run screaming from this room. All I&nbsp;could say was “Wow. That is&nbsp;a&nbsp;really impressive collection!” <a href=#>@carmium</a></li><li>I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;neighbor that puts pressure on&nbsp;the city’s office to&nbsp;check and see whether or&nbsp;not our backyard is&nbsp;clean enough. We, that is&nbsp;my&nbsp;family and&nbsp;I, are not the cleanest of&nbsp;people. I&nbsp;mean to&nbsp;say, we&nbsp;do&nbsp;not really care if&nbsp;our lawn is&nbsp;infested with dandelions or&nbsp;any other weeds, we&nbsp;still mow it&nbsp;but we&nbsp;do&nbsp;not treat&nbsp;it. The guy in&nbsp;question takes pictures of&nbsp;our so-called scrapyard and asks the city’s inspector to&nbsp;penalize&nbsp;us if&nbsp;we&nbsp;do&nbsp;not cooperate with his standard of&nbsp;beauty. <a href=#>@starniac</a></li><li readability=3.8870588235294><p>I&nbsp;got home from work one snowy winter day after some new neighbors had recently moved&nbsp;in. They invited me&nbsp;in, but they apparently decided that paying for electrical baseboard heating throughout their apartment was too expensive... So&nbsp;they had a&nbsp;propane grill lit in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the kitchen... Politely made a&nbsp;quick escape and called the landlord immediately. Luckily, they didn’t burn the place down. <a href=#>@immapikachu</a></p></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/bc4/1fa/e7dc5a5a3eb29744948975b908.jpeg><ul><li>My&nbsp;mother was cleaning up&nbsp;the top shelf of&nbsp;the closet, fell with a&nbsp;heavy suitcase on&nbsp;top, and broke her ankle and leg. When the ambulance arrived, a&nbsp;whole family of&nbsp;neighbors, who never spoke to&nbsp;us before, busted into the house with the paramedics. My&nbsp;father was this close to&nbsp;literally punching everyone and kicking them out. <a href=#>@FlaxSeedBP</a></li><li>They would scream and fight at&nbsp;all hours of&nbsp;the night. Their children would throw eggs at&nbsp;our house, and bubble gum over the fence so&nbsp;that our dogs would eat&nbsp;it (...I have no&nbsp;idea why). The kids would climb over the fence and jump onto our gazebo, and take our grape leaves (for cooking). The father and uncle drove tow trucks and would speed down the street, screech to&nbsp;a&nbsp;halt, and park in&nbsp;the yard. They had, like, 5&nbsp;beat up&nbsp;old cars in&nbsp;their driveway at&nbsp;all times. They had chickens and a&nbsp;goat in&nbsp;the backyard. <a href=#>@sweet_sparrow</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b4f/959/35156a5f4e94e7f222470e1f9d.jpg><ul><li>We&nbsp;had several crazy, but harmless neighbors, except the one right next door. We, innocently enough, thought nothing of&nbsp;leaving the blinds open on&nbsp;the side of&nbsp;the house that faced him. One morning&nbsp;I was home alone and walked past a&nbsp;window in&nbsp;just my&nbsp;bra and underwear. I&nbsp;glanced toward the direction of&nbsp;his house and he&nbsp;was standing in&nbsp;just his underwear staring directly at&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;freaked out, dropped to&nbsp;the floor, and literally crawled away. His bedroom window was no&nbsp;more than 20&nbsp;feet from our house. Every time we&nbsp;would look out or&nbsp;go&nbsp;outside, he&nbsp;would stand with his face pushed up&nbsp;against the window and stare at&nbsp;us, while making a&nbsp;weird chattery sound with his teeth. <a href=#>@tessyfink</a></li><li>A&nbsp;neighbor decided to&nbsp;place a&nbsp;rotten sandwich on&nbsp;my&nbsp;porch. The sandwich was not mine, so&nbsp;the next morning&nbsp;I put it&nbsp;back on&nbsp;the curb where she first found&nbsp;it. The next morning the sandwich appeared on&nbsp;my&nbsp;welcome mat. I&nbsp;return it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the curb. This kept going on&nbsp;for a&nbsp;week, with the sandwich finding itself in&nbsp;my&nbsp;mailbox, wedged into my&nbsp;screen door, etc., and finally ending with screams and threats being traded from our respective porches. Could this all have been avoided if&nbsp;I had just put the Arby’s sandwich in&nbsp;the trash after Connie first put it&nbsp;on&nbsp;my&nbsp;porch? Absolutely. So&nbsp;this is&nbsp;the story of&nbsp;2&nbsp;crazy neighbors. <a href=#>@JoelleVD</a></li><li>One day at&nbsp;roughly 2&nbsp;AM I&nbsp;heard banging on&nbsp;our door, so&nbsp;I answered it&nbsp;quite carefully, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was late. It&nbsp;was the neighbor from upstairs. He&nbsp;just stared at&nbsp;me, not replying to&nbsp;anything I&nbsp;said, so&nbsp;eventually&nbsp;I shut the door on&nbsp;him and went back to&nbsp;sleep. This carried on&nbsp;every couple of&nbsp;days or&nbsp;so. I’m a&nbsp;very very patient man, but someone waking me&nbsp;up&nbsp;every night at&nbsp;2&nbsp;AM when&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;leave for work at&nbsp;5:30&nbsp;AM, was starting to&nbsp;drive me&nbsp;insane. Then I&nbsp;realized he&nbsp;was following&nbsp;us around regularly and being generally creepy, hiding behind bushes, etc. The next night&nbsp;I hear banging on&nbsp;the door again and he&nbsp;starts shouting at&nbsp;me&nbsp;saying&nbsp;I stole his microwave? I&nbsp;call the police, they turn&nbsp;up, and calm him down. We&nbsp;still see him occasionally following&nbsp;us, even though we’ve moved to&nbsp;a&nbsp;different city and have lived here for years. <a href=#>@chaoswolf7115</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3a7/7ee/32ddff5911bc108f8923bc5e6a.jpg><ul readability=1.9583727530747><li>I&nbsp;work on&nbsp;my&nbsp;own cars sometimes in&nbsp;my&nbsp;driveway. I&nbsp;occasionally make noise with my&nbsp;cars or&nbsp;tools I’m using, but it’s nothing more than what you’d hear from an&nbsp;assortment of&nbsp;gardeners. Yet my&nbsp;neighbor has decided to&nbsp;wage a&nbsp;war against&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;frequently calls the cops on&nbsp;me&nbsp;and lies to&nbsp;them, he&nbsp;tells them I’m running a&nbsp;chop shop in&nbsp;my&nbsp;garage, and that I’m working until midnight, neither of&nbsp;which are true. He&nbsp;trash talks me&nbsp;to&nbsp;our other neighbors and is&nbsp;constantly going out of&nbsp;his way to&nbsp;make my&nbsp;life miserable. It’s gotten so&nbsp;bad that he&nbsp;has literally forced&nbsp;us out of&nbsp;the neighborhood. <a href=#>@let_them_burn</a></li><li readability=6.8624078624079><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;kid, I’d take my&nbsp;dog on&nbsp;a&nbsp;walk.

Lady comes out and tells me&nbsp;to ’stop antagonizing [her] dog’ and saying&nbsp;I wasn’t allowed to&nbsp;walk my&nbsp;dog on&nbsp;that street anymore.

They had flood lights on&nbsp;24/7&nbsp;on all sides of&nbsp;their home, a&nbsp;mid ’90s car in&nbsp;the driveway that&nbsp;I never saw move, and the only glimpse of&nbsp;the person&nbsp;I ever saw was their hand, while holding a&nbsp;camcorder and recording everything we&nbsp;did. They would fill whole pages of&nbsp;paper with rants and tape them to&nbsp;their window so&nbsp;that we&nbsp;could read them. I&nbsp;read a&nbsp;couple and, at&nbsp;best, I&nbsp;could describe them as&nbsp;random words. I&nbsp;couldn’t tell you their age, or&nbsp;gender, but that hand holding a&nbsp;camera still freaks me&nbsp;out. <a href=#>@luckyhunterdude</a></li><li>I’ve got 3&nbsp;of&nbsp;these ladies living in&nbsp;my&nbsp;parents neighborhood. Every time I&nbsp;visit, and they find&nbsp;me, I&nbsp;get updates on&nbsp;people that&nbsp;I haven’t seen in&nbsp;a&nbsp;decade, or&nbsp;have never seen at&nbsp;all. The weird thing is&nbsp;most of&nbsp;their families are super relaxed. I&nbsp;don’t know how they deal with&nbsp;it. <a href=#>@Herrier335</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/57e/81c/f2438b54379705ecf01309fba4.jpg><ul><li>My&nbsp;crazy neighbor would get upset if&nbsp;everyone didn’t pull their trash cans in&nbsp;immediately after the truck came. Trash day was on&nbsp;a&nbsp;weekday, so&nbsp;I couldn’t bring my&nbsp;cans in&nbsp;until after&nbsp;I got off work. Needless to&nbsp;say this totally pissed her off. It&nbsp;started with her just spinning the can around, or&nbsp;moving it&nbsp;in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;my&nbsp;garage. Eventually it&nbsp;escalates to&nbsp;her knocking it&nbsp;over or&nbsp;pushing it&nbsp;across the street into a&nbsp;small park. Eventually, I’d had enough. I&nbsp;bought a&nbsp;tube of&nbsp;marine grease and lathered up&nbsp;the handles, and then took the can out with a&nbsp;pair of&nbsp;gloves before heading out for work. When I&nbsp;came home, the can was moved a&nbsp;few feet and sure enough her little hands had left a&nbsp;big imprint in&nbsp;the grease. <a href=#>@addennis</a></li><li>We&nbsp;have had several sets of&nbsp;crazy neighbors, but my&nbsp;favorites were&nbsp;J &&nbsp;Y.&nbsp;One time we&nbsp;were late on&nbsp;our water bill, and, here, the water company can cut off your water if&nbsp;you don’t pay. The truck came and the guy gets out and shuts off our water, and then drives away. Immediately J&nbsp;explodes from his house with the largest wrench&nbsp;I have ever seen in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life, (bigger than a&nbsp;small child) screaming curses at&nbsp;the retreating water company truck, runs to&nbsp;the front of&nbsp;our house, opens up&nbsp;the door in&nbsp;the sidewalk, and turns our water back&nbsp;on. Then walks back into his house, still muttering, and walks&nbsp;in, slamming the door behind him. <a href=#>@rbkc1234</a></li><li>While looking out the window, I&nbsp;saw a&nbsp;middle-aged woman who was yelling at&nbsp;her upstairs neighbor for stealing her raccoon. Yes, she yelled that it&nbsp;was her raccoon because she left a&nbsp;bag of&nbsp;sugar out for&nbsp;it, which is&nbsp;apparently a&nbsp;delicacy to&nbsp;raccoons. The raccoon was on&nbsp;the upstairs neighbors’ balcony, so&nbsp;to&nbsp;get it&nbsp;back she constructed this ramshackle stairway of&nbsp;garbage (upturned garbage cans, broken chairs, etc.) and tried to&nbsp;climb up&nbsp;while wielding a&nbsp;hula hoop. She managed to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;the garbage mountain and somehow thought she could trap the raccoon with a&nbsp;hula hoop (????). The other neighbor came out and a&nbsp;fight ensued with the upstairs neighbor biting the woman. Police were called. The raccoon was never seen again. <a href=#>@mandolinwars</a></li></ul><p>Did you like these stories? Do&nbsp;you have any similar ones you’d like to&nbsp;tell&nbsp;us?
