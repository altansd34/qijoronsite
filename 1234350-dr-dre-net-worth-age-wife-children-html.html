His birth name was Andre Romelle Young. His parents were Theodore and Verna Young who got married in 1964. They decided to give him the name Romelle after his father’s amateur R7B group called The Romells. However, in 1972, his parents got divorced. Theodore moved on and eventually got remarried to Curtis Crayon. Theodore and Crayon had three children who are the late Jerome and Tyree, and a daughter called Shameka.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1cbbedff7781e0fd.jpg><p class=align-left>In 1976, he enrolled in the Vanguard Junior High School. The school was in an area prone to so much gun violence. Young, therefore, filed for a transfer from Vanguard Junior High School to the suburban Roosevelt Junior High School. During this period, his mother got remarried to Warren Griffin with whom she got four more kids. It meant that Young had acquired three more stepsisters and one more step brother called Warren G.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0904f61708ead7d3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>600Breezy biography: age, height, real name, kids, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Later in 1979, he attended Centennial High School in Compton, but then transferred to Fremont High School in South Central Los Angeles because of his poor grades. He decided to try his luck and enrol in an apprenticeship program at the Northrop Aviation Company. However, given his poor grades, Young was unsuitable for the program. Due to all the changes in his family and school life, he found music as his only solace. Therefore, in the last of his high school years, he concentrated more on his social and entertainment experience.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Ryan Destiny bio: age, height, ethnicity, parents, boyfriend, net worth</p><h2>How old is Young?</h2><p class=align-left>Andre was born on the 18th of February in 1965.

They got married in May 1996. However, given that Romelle is known to father other kids from different wives, there are always speculations about Dr Dre wives.

Threatt is a legal practitioner who was previously married to the retired NBA superstar Sedale Threatt.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f5bbc51347bde188.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Larry David: Most fascinating facts about the life of the best comedian of all time</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5894bd82210556ef.jpg><h2>How many kids does Dre have?</h2><p class=align-left>Young is known to father a lot of kids from different women. It is alleged that majority of his fans believe that this unstable upbringing and changes in family ties have a lot to do with the many kids he currently fathers. Young has seven children with five different women. Of the seven children, four are sons, while the remaining three are daughters. Here is a list of Dr Dre kids:</p><h3>Curtis Young Dr. Dre son</h3><p class=align-left>Curtis is the first born of Young. He was born on the 15th of December in 1981. His mother is Cassandra Joy Greene. However, he was not brought up by his biological father, Romelle. Instead, he grew up with his mother and stepfather. One thing that stands out is the fact that he took after the shoes of his biological father. It is because he also ventured into music, and especially rapping.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/19af61b956253273.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Find out the most interesting facts about Cash Warren, Jessica Alba's husband</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Given that most rappers have rapping names that they usually want their fans to remember and acknowledge easily, Curtis also acquired a new name for himself. He went by the rapper name Hood Surgeon. After twenty years of not knowing his biological father, he met with him. One can only imagine this emotional first encounter.</p><h3>La Tanya Danielle Young</h3><p class=align-left>La Tanya is one of the daughters of Romelle. She was born in January 1983 by Lisa Johnson. La Tanya is the first daughter of Romelle.</p><h3>Tyra Young Dr. Dre</h3><p class=align-left>There is little information about this daughter of Young. She seems to have managed to keep her personal life very private.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/661f3948316a7749.jpg><h3>Andre Young Jr.</h3><p class=align-left>Andre was the son of Dr. Dre and Jenita Porter. He was born in 1988. In 1990, his mother Jenita sued the father for child support. However, he later passed on at the age of 20 in 2009 due to drug abuse. It was after conformations that he had overdosed on heroin and morphine.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d0b5d4319fee4153.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ice Cube net worth in 2019 will wow you</span></p></a><h3>Marcel Young</h3><p class=align-left>Dre is also said to father a son called Marcel with Michel’le.

He is their first son who was born in 1997.</p><h3>Truly Young</h3><p class=align-left>Truly Young is the second born of Dr. Dre and Nicole Threatt. She was born in 2001. Truly is the youngest daughter of this mogul.</p><p class=align-left>It is pretty evident that Dr. Dre is insanely talented. His music career mixed with his entrepreneurial culture has contributed so much to Dr. Dre net worth of 2019, which rests at $850 million. Aside from working on solo projects, he has also intervened to nurture and drive music careers of so many talented rappers today such as Eminem and The Game.
